1/30/2020
  6:19pm - 9:19pm
  	Begin connecting graphs. Zoom in zoomable treemap zooms in pack
  		-add unique id for each circle or square
  		-fire click event
  		-how to ensure they are the truly unique ids?
  			debug similar children names

2/1/2020
	5:00pm-6:00pm
	10:30pm-11:30pm
		Build recursive function to build the unique id for the circle graph

2/2/2020
	9:00pm-11:00pm
		Begin building on the "click pack graph, zoom in on zoomable tree"

2/3/2020
	6:00pm - 8:00pm
		Begin building full algorithm to identify what hidden ids in
		zoomable can be connected to pack ids.
			-zoom in on pack with hidden zoomables, expose zoomables

2/5/2020
	5:30pm to 7:30pm
		Iterate, drill down into zoomable treemap ids
